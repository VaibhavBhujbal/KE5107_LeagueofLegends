This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
match_categories <- unique(matches$Type)
print(match_categories)
print(length(match_categories))

# Question : Do we need to segregate the matches by type? 
#            How does type influence the match gameplay? 

```
```{r}
# golddiff is defined as goldblue - goldred, by the minute
# we can remove goldblue, goldred? Is the actual quantity significant? 

# extract just golddiff for analysis
just_gold_diff = gsub("\\[|\\]", "", matches$golddiff)
golddiff_split_by_min = do.call("rbind", strsplit(just_gold_diff, ",")) # remove the , 
golddiff_split_by_min = data.frame(apply(golddiff_split_by_min, 2, as.numeric)) # convert str to num
head(golddiff_split_by_min)
```
```{r}
plot(colMeans(golddiff_split_by_min), type="b", xlab="Minutes", ylab="Average Gold Diff (Blue - Red)")
# Insanely skewed towards blue! No negative vlaues at all. Did I miss something? 
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
